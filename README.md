# Mobi
Writer/Reader for Mobi format.

**Note:** All testing were done on `Kindle Previewer` (Windows) and `Kindle Paperwhite (6th Gen)`

## Before You Start
- THis is more or less WIP. Use at your own risk.
- This package was written for a specific task, thus there are certain limitations, such as:
    - `img` tags are ignored and not embedded.
    - TOC depth does not go beyond 1. Meaning for now you can only have chapters and sub-chapters. But sub-chaper can not have it's own sub-chapters.
- HTML formatting is supported, but rendering is dependant on your eBook reader. (For Kindle see [Supported HTML Tags in Book Content](https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A1JPUWCSD6F59O))
- Cover images should be in JPG (I have not tested GIF, which sould be [supported](https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A1B6GKJ79HC7AN)). 
	- **IMPORTANT**: Images resized using `image/jpeg` package will not display (in Kindle) because [JFIF APP0 marker segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format#JFIF_APP0_marker_segment) is not generated by `image/jpeg` package.
- Table of Content is automaticaly generated.

## Usage
### Writer

	m, err := mobi.NewWriter("output.mobi")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	
	m.Title("Book Title")
	m.Compression(mobi.CompressionNone) // LZ77 compression is also possible using  mobi.CompressionPalmDoc

    // Add cover image
    m.AddCover("data/cover.jpg", "data/thumbnail.jpg")

	// Add chapters and subchapters
    ch1 := m.NewChapter("Chapter 1", []byte("Some text here"))
    ch1.AddSubChapter("Chapter 1-1", []byte("Some text here"))
    ch1.AddSubChapter("Chapter 1-2", []byte("Some text here"))

	m.NewChapter("Chapter 2", []byte("Some text here")).AddSubChapter("Chapter 2-1", []byte("Some text here")).AddSubChapter("Chapter 2-2", []byte("Some text here"))
	m.NewChapter("Chapter 3", []byte("Some text here")).AddSubChapter("Chapter 3-1", []byte("Some text here"))
	m.NewChapter("Chapter 4", []byte("Some text here")).AddSubChapter("Chapter 4-1", []byte("Some text here"))

    // Output MOBI File
	m.Write()

### Reader
For now, Reader does not give any useful information.
